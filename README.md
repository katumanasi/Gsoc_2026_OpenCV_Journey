# GSoC 2026 Journey - Manasi Katu

| Date | Task | What I Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jan 15 | Git & `browse.py` | Learned about "Safety Guards" (if statements) to prevent code crashes and made my 1st commit. |
| Jan 16 | `calibrate.py` | Documentation! Improved the "Docstring" so humans can understand the math. |
| Jan 17 | `edge.py` | Learned about Thresholds. Moving the slider right = higher threshold = fewer lines. |
