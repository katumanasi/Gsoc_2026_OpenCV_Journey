# GSoC 2026 Journey - Manasi Katu

| Date | Task | What I Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jan 15 | Git & `browse.py` | Learned about "Safety Guards" (if statements) to prevent code crashes and made my 1st commit. |
| Jan 16 | `calibrate.py` | Documentation! Improved the "Docstring" so humans can understand the math. |
| Jan 17 | `edge.py` | Learned about Thresholds. Moving the slider right = higher threshold = fewer lines. |
| Jan 19 | `find_obj.py` | Learned the Lowe's Ratio Test. Lowering the ratio makes the computer a 'stricter' detective. |
| Jan 21 | `GSOC Research & Stratey` | Organizations apply to Google between Jan 19 and Feb 11. I learned that I must look for the "Ideas Page" to start choosing a project early.|
| Jan 22|`aruco_test.py` | 1ArUco Detection,Successfully detected Marker ID 17 using Python. Mastered grayscale conversion and flip-correction for better detection. |
| Jan 27 | Milestone | Completed first professional Git commit on the OpenCV source tree. Adhered to library naming conventions for commit messages. |
 Feb 2 | Sample Improvement | Enhanced opt_flow.py by adding a real-time HUD (Heads-Up Display) to track visualization states. This improves sample usability for new developers.|
| Feb 11 | Robustness | The ability of program to handle errors during execution | added isOpened() check to edge.py
| Feb 11 | Validation | Checking if data i valid before execution | Added img is none check before cvtColor |
